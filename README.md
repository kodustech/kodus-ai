## Why Kodus?

Kodus is an open-source AI agent that reviews your code like a real teammate — but one that never gets tired of doing pull requests.

She helps your team catch bugs, enforce best practices, and keep your codebase clean without slowing you down. Think of her as that senior dev who actually likes doing reviews (yeah, we made one).

Kody (our agent) plugs into your Git workflow, learns how your team writes code, and starts reviewing PRs automatically. You decide what matters — performance, security, readability, or all of the above.

### Key Features

- **Context-Aware Intelligence** — Kodus learns your codebase, architecture patterns, and team standards to deliver relevant, actionable feedback.

- **Custom Review Policies** — Create review guidelines in plain language, or any language of your choice, that align with your team's engineering principles and practices.

- **Native Git Integration** — Seamlessly integrates with your existing workflow, providing detailed feedback directly in pull requests.

- **Continuous Learning** — Improves over time by incorporating feedback and adapting to your team's preferences and standards.
